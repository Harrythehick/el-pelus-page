        <p>Let me better explain. See my name is Harry, which very much sounds like "hairy"; and in spanish "hairy" is "Pelu" for short. Since my sounds like "Pelu" in English (and since I indeed have a lot of hair), "El Pelu" has beome my nickname. This explains the Title to my personal website!</p>
